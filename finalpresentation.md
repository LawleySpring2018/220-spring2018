# Final Project Presentation

At the end of the semester, your group will give a presentation of your game. In addition to presenting the final version of the game, and distributing the one-page design document (either the original, or an updated versio if you prefer), you will also do a post-mortem of the design and development process.

The post-mortem is a time of reflection. Do make a powerpoint presentation, but think IGNITE. Ideally  powerpoint should have photographs or screenshots of your game prototype, and in general should focus on images to support your presentation, not on bullet points or blocks of text.

Here are some things you should probably include in the presentation:

* What was the original concept for your game?
* How is the game played? (brief walkthrough)
* What worked well in your playtests? What didn't? 
* How has the game changed over the semester?
* How did you apply what you learned in the readings and lectures? 
* What worked (and/or didn't work) well in your teamâ€™s workflow, division of responsibilities, and communication?

You should plan on taking 10-15 minutes for the presentation, after which I may follow up with questions. It is up to you how to balance responsibility for the presentation--I do not require that all team members speak during the presentation, but I may direct questions at any or all of you during the follow-up.
