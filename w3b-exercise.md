#In-Class Group Exercise: Genre/Audience Brainstorming

For this exercise, I'll divide you into three groups of 3 or 4 people each.   

## Part 1: Genres, Themes, and Audiences (ten minutes)

The first group is going to make a list of as many game genres as they can think of, including both video game and board game genres. There is some overlap between core dynamics and genres, but they're not identical. "Race to the end" could be used as a genre as well as a core dynamic, but FPS, MMOs, and MOBAs are all genres but not core dynamics. 

The second group is going to make a list of as many game themes as they can think of. Themes are not genres or core dynamics--they have to do with the subject matter of the game (e.g. railroad, cooking, zombie, high fantasy, civil war, etc). 

The third group is going to make a list of as many audiences as they can think of (preschool children, primary school children, teenagers, parents of small children, college students, blind people, deaf people, senior citizens, people from a specific country, etc). 

Create a written list as you brainstorm--you'll need it later. When the ten minutes is up, write each of your items on a small piece of paper, fold it in half, and put it into one of the three containers I provide. 

## Part 2: Choosing and Brainstorming

Each group will choose two pieces of paper from all three collections. (You can have one person draw all the pieces, or you can split it up as you see fit.) Your group now has two genres, two themes, and two target audiences. Decide how you want to combine them (you need two sets of genre/theme/audience), then come up with at least one game idea for each of the two sets. 

As a group, write a description of each game idea. Your description should use the MDA framework to address the mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics of the game. 
	

## Part 3: Submitting Your Results

Put both of your game descriptions into a single document and upload it to the group dropbox in myCourses by 6pm on Friday.
