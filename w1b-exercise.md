# Week 1 Thursday Exercise/Homework

## Part 1: What's a Game?
You’ve now read, and heard, a lot of definitions of what a game is (or isn't).  Which did you find most convincing, if any? Why? How would you now define a game? Write a paragraph or two explaining. 

## Part 2: Your Gamer Story
Write your own “gamer story” focusing on digital games that were influential for you. What was the first game you remember playing? What was that experience like? What are the games you've loved the most? What are the ones you've spent the most time playing? 

## Part 3: Your Gamer Motivation Profile
Complete the Quantic Foundry “Gamer Motivation Profile” survey. (Do the board game survey after you finish the video game survey.) How accurate did you think the profiles you received were? Did you think the game recommendations were good? Write up your thoughts on your profile, and include the profile with your document. 

Submit the final document to the myCourses Dropbox by 6pm on Saturday, 20 January.
