# Week 2 Thursday Exercise/Homework: Applying Game Models to Analysis

In Chapter Three of the Fullerton book, she describes the many formal elements that make up games. In the in-class exercise, you focused on those elements in the context of a very simple game.

In Chapter Four of the Schell book, he uses the MAST four-part model-Mechanics, Aesthetics, Story, and Technology. While it seems simpler, many of the elements that Fullerton discusses are grouped together in Schell's very broad "Mechanics" category.

And finally, in the MDA article, Hunicke, LeBlanc, and Zubek discuss the MDA (Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics)--or "Rules, System, and Fun"--which focuses as much on the player experience as it does on the components of the game. 

Choose one of the three models you read about, and use it to analyze two different games-one analog game (a card game, board game, playground game, etc), and one digital game. Include a 1-2 sentence description of the game at the beginning, and then use the model you selected to describe the elements of the game.  (You can use the game you observed in the last exercise, but you're not required to.)

Put both of your game descriptions into a single document and upload it to the dropbox in myCourses by noon on Saturday (27 Jan).
