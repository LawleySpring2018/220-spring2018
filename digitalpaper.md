# Analog Game Analysis Paper

Write a thorough analysis of a digital game. It should be a game that you have access to here in Dubrovnik, so that you can observe yourself and others playing it. (Alternatively, you can write about a game that you played and observed others playing at Reboot.) 

Each student must pick a different game to analyze; use Slack to coordinate your choices. 

## Required Elements

### Game Details
At the beginning of the paper, you should fully identify the game you are analyzing, including the name of the publisher and designer (if available), and the year of publication or first appearance (again, if available). Cite your source(s) for this. If you are unable to find the information, describe where you looked for it. 

### Formal Elements
Identify the formal elements of the game, using either chapter 3 of the Fullerton book, or Greg Costikyan's essay ["I Have No Words & I Must Design"](costikyan.pdf). 

### Gameplay Experience and Dramatic Elements
Describe your experience of playing the game, as well as observations you have made of others playing it. Using the material from chapter 4 of the Fullerton book, or Costikyan's essay (linked above), analyze why it was fun (or not fun if that was the case)--for you as well as for those you observed. 

Avoid using hyperbole and descriptive adjectives such as "brilliant" or "great." Instead, explain why and how specific game elements work or do not work. You can also discuss how you think that specific elements could be modified to make the game better or more interesting. 

### Literature Review
Has this game been reviewed or analyzed by others? (You'll need to do some research to determine this.) If so, did you agree or disagree with their assessment? Why or why not?

## Citing Your Sources
Ideas and concepts that are not your original ideas ***must be cited***. Sources of factual material about the game ("it is the most popular card game ever", "it was the first game of type X ever released", "it received poor reviews", etc) must always be cited. Quotations must always be cited. Paraphrases must always be cited. If you use a source without proper citation, the assignment will be graded a zero and you may fail the course for plagiarism. When in doubt, ask me! 

## Mechanics
* The paper is due by noon on Sunday, 6 May. It must be submitted to the Dropbox in myCourses in Word (.doc or .docx) or PDF format. 
* It must be at least 1000 words in length, but no longer than 1500 words. (Word count does not include your name, the title, references, abstracts, etc.)
* It should be spell-checked and proofread. Proper grammar and word usage is required.
