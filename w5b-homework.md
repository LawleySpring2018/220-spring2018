# Gameplay Storyboard

Create a storyboard that walks through the basic gameplay of your game. PowerPoint works pretty well for this, but you can use whatever tool(s) you prefer. I'm not concerned about artistic value, but it will benefit from some visuals (even if they're just rough hand-drawn schematics). 

Basic components that would be good to include:

* What's in the box? When I open it up, what components are there? 
* Game setup (how long does it take?)
* Any actions that  happen at only at the start
* Player turn(s), broken down into stages if necessary
    * Start of turn
    * Possible actions (draw, roll, attack, etc)
    * End of turn
* End of game

(This is not a comprehensive list; you may have other things that need to be included. You also may not need everything in the list.)

Submit the storyboard to the group dropbox by 8am on Tuesday, 20 February.
