# Week 2: Game Description and Observation Exercise

## Part 1 
Choose a game that you have easy access to (e.g. something on your phone, something I've brought to class, or something you can play on a lab computer). Spend 5-10 minutes *briefly* describing the following aspects of the game (you'll have a chance to expand this later):
* Players
* Objective
* Procedures
* Rules
* Conflict
* Boundaries
* Outcome

## Part 2
Take on the role of a tester. Play the game you wrote about in the quiz, and observe yourself as you play. Pay attention to what you're doing and feeling as you play the game. Take detailed notes on your behaviors, actions, and reactions.

## Part 3
Repeat this experience while watching another person or group play the same game. (It can be a classmate, but doesn't have to be.) This time take notes on the other person's behaviors, actions, and reactions. Don't try to do this while you're also playing the game.

***Playtesting guidelines from the chapter:*** "Observe their experience and try to see the game through their eyes. Pay attention to what objects they are focused on, where they touch the screen or move the cursor when they get stuck or frustrated or bored, and write down everything they tell you. They are your guide, and it's your mission to have them lead you inside the game and illuminate any issues lurking below the surface of the design . If you train yourself to do this, you will regain your objectivity and be able to see both the beauty and the flaws in what you've created. "

## Part 4
Compare your notes from parts 2 and 3, and write at least one page describing what you learned from the exercise. 

## Part 5
Make any changes or additions necessary to your description from part 1. If the game has dramatic elements, describe those as well:

* Challenge
* Play
* Premise/Character/Story

## Deliverable
Combine all four documents-the game description, the notes about your experience, the notes about the observed experience, and what you learned-into one document, and submit it to the dropbox no later than 8am on Thursday, 25 January.
