# Week 2: Game Description and Observation Exercise

## Step 1: Choose and Describe a Game
Choose a game that you have easy access to (e.g. something on your phone, something I've brought to class, or something you can play on a lab computer). Spend 5-10 minutes writing a *brief* description of the game, including as much of the following as possible (you'll be able to revise and expand this later):
* Summary (1-2 lines max)
* Core Dynamic(s)
* Players
* Procedures & Rules
* Conflict
* Boundaries
* Goals/Outcomes/Win Conditions

***List of core dynamics from today's lecture:*** Territorial Acquisition, Exploration, Prediction, Spatial Reasoning/Alignment, Matching, Survival, Destruction, Building, Collection, Chasing/Evading, Trading, Race to the End, Capture, Escape/Rescue, Forbidden Act

## Step 2: Test the Game Yourself
Take on the role of a tester. Play the game you wrote about in the quiz, and observe yourself as you play. Pay attention to what you're doing and feeling as you play the game. Take detailed notes on your behaviors, actions, and reactions.

## Step 3: Observe Other Players
Repeat this experience while watching another person or group play the same game. (It can be a classmate, but doesn't have to be.) This time take notes on the other person's behaviors, actions, and reactions. If possible, try to avoid doing this while you're also playing the game.

***Playtesting guidelines from the chapter:*** "Observe their experience and try to see the game through their eyes. Pay attention to what objects they are focused on, where they touch the screen or move the cursor when they get stuck or frustrated or bored, and write down everything they tell you. They are your guide, and it's your mission to have them lead you inside the game and illuminate any issues lurking below the surface of the design . If you train yourself to do this, you will regain your objectivity and be able to see both the beauty and the flaws in what you've created. "

## Step 4: Compare and Analyze Your Observations
Compare your notes from parts 2 and 3, and write at least one page describing differences between what you experienced and what you observed in others, and what you learned from these observations. 

## Step 5: Update and Expand Your Description
If necessary, make any changes or additions to your description from step 1. Add in a description of the dramatic (emotionally engaging) elements of the game: challenge, playfulness/fun, characters, story/theme

## Deliverable (Due Thursday morning)
Combine all four documents-the game description, the notes about your play experience, the notes about the observed play experience, and what you learned-into one document, and submit it to the dropbox before class on Thursday, 25 January.
